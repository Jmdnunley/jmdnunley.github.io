/**
 * Pseudocode:
 * /*Purpose
 *     Pseudocode has no specific syntax and is used by the programmer to outline or comment on the code within our
 *     program. The act of psudocoding allows us to break our code down into smaller, easy to digest, instructions or
 *     refrence. By breaking our code down we are able to go back or leave a trail of valuable information behind for 
 *     potential future debugging or usage in general. 
 *     As programmers we can pretty much psuedocode any where in our code as needed but some common places are before
 *     a code as instructions on what is about to take place or on each line after the code has been written. 
 *     It is okay to mark our code up with these smaller bits of information because the JavaScript interpreter does not
 *     read not read it as apart of our code as long ass it is noted properly. It is soley for us as the programmer or for
 *     any eyes that follow. 
 * 
 * /*Types
 *     Comments are the way we psudocode. There are two comment styles:
 *     1. Single Line Comments: We use // to notate a single line of psudocoded comment. 
 *     2. Multi Line Commensts: We use /* to notate a multi line comment. This comment will extend past our single line 
 *        comment and typically into the next line, hence the name "multi line". Multi line comments must be closed with
 *        */
 /** Use
 *     Single Line Comments used in our code: 
 *     var myBusiness = 'November Alpha Clothing';//init new var named myBusiness w/ 'November Alpha Clothing' as value
 *                                                        ^^^^^^^^^ This is our single line comment.
 *     Multi Line Comments used in our code:
 *     /* Create a var named itemsForSale that hold key/values 
 *         of items currently for sale on Novemberalphaclothing.com
 *         each items should have the name, color option, and sizes.*/
 /*    
 *      var itemsForSale = { 
 *      tshirt: 'Ambitious Tee'
 *      colors: ['white and red', 'black and white', 'white and black'],
 *      sizes:  ['XS', 'S', 'M', 'L', 'XL', 'XXL'],
 *      
 *      hoodies: 'Unforgettable',
 *      colors: ['Olive and Cream', 'Black and White'],
 *      sizes:  ['XS', 'S', 'M', 'L', 'XL', 'XXL']
