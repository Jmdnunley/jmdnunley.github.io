/** 
* OPERATORS
* /* Purpose
*             
* 
*
* 
* /* TYPES
* 1. Assignment operators: 
*      += : Addition assignment: Adds value of the right operand to a variable and assigns the result to the 
*           variable.
*      -= : Subtraction assignment: Subtracts the value of the right operand from a variable and assigns the     
*           result.
*      *= : Multiplication assignment: Multiplies a variable by the value of the right operand and assigns the 
*           result to the variable. 
*      /= : Division assignment: Divides a variable by the value of the right operand and assigns it to the result
*           to the variable.
* 
* 2. Arithmatic operators: Return numerical value 
*      + : Addition
*      - : Subtraction
*      * : Multiplication/Multiply
*      / : Divide
*      % : Remainder
*
* 3. Comparison operators:
*      > : Greater than
*      < : Less than
*     >= : Greater than or equal
*     <= : Less than or equal to
*     === : Strict equality
*     !== : Strict inequality
*
* 4. Logical operators: 
*      ! : NOT/BANG: forces whatever is next to it to be the oposite.
*     && : And: Both values have to be true to return true used when you n eed two things to be true.
*     || : Or: Both values have to be true to return true used when you n eed two things to be true.
*     
*
*
* 5. Unary operators(!, typeOf, -): 
*

* 6. Tenary operator(a ? b : c):
