/**
 * Control Flow:
 * /*Purpose:
 *      0: Our code is ran in sequence, from top to bottom. The control flow is the way our computer executes statements
 *      in a script. Conditional statements allow us to control the flow of our code. These conditional statements 
 *      are given a set of instructions. They check for specific condtions and will execute if those conditions given are true. 
 *      If false, the code will contiue to follow the flow of whatever instructions we have given the code to further execute.
 *      
 *      In order to initiate flow through our conditional statements we must start with the what is called an if statement. 
 *      When we use the if statement 
 *
